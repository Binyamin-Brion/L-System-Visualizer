# L-System-Visualizer

## Overview

An L-System is a way of specifying geometrical structures through the use of a formal grammar. This system consists of the following components:

* Variables: A set of symbols that can are be replaced with some other tokens.
* Constants: A set of symbols which cannot be replaced with other tokens.
* Axiom: The starting token of the system, which is either a variable or a constant.
* Rules: Define ways to replace variables with other variables and constants.
         Together, these components can be used to generate geometrical structures in a recursive manner. 
         
This project provides a grpahical means to specify an L-Script by providing a GUI to create the above 
components, and render the resulting generated geometrical structure.

## Features

* Specify required components of an L-System through a GUI interface
* Execute the L-Script up to a specified recursion depth
* Get error messages related to the execution of theL-Script
* View rendered result of the L-System (with textures) by specifying models to use for rendering
* Execute the L-Script as a stochastic grammar, with the ability to save a particular execution result
* Add specific instances of models used in the render in addition to what was generated by the L-Script
* Save a project, and reopen it later to view it

## User Guide

A user guide in both PDF and docx form is provided in the 'User Guide' folder, which is itself located in the Docs folder.

## Technologies Used

* C++14
* Qt5.9.8
* OpenGL 4.4


## Compilation Note

In addition to needing Qt5.9.8 and a C++14 compliant compiler, the location to the Qt installation, and the location of the
glm (math library) folder will need to be updated in the CMake file to match where it is installed on the machine being used for compilation.

## Run-time Note:

The computer on which the program is being executed on must support OpenGL 4.4 .
