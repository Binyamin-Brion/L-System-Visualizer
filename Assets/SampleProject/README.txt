To open this sample project, load the sampleTree.L_Vis project file in the program.

Before that's done, change modify the .mtl files in this folder and update the texture locations
to point to the full path to the textures in this folder. For example:

    Leaves location in bark.mtl right now: /Voxel_L_System/Assets/SampleProject/bark.jpeg

    Change it to, for instance: /home/myHomeFolder/Voxel_L_System/Assets/SampleProject/bark.jpeg

                                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
                                    added this

Modify the variables in the sampleTree.L_Vis folder as well to an absolute location. For example:

        northBranch association model location right now: /Voxel_L_System/Assets/SampleProject/branch.obj

        Change it to, for instance: /home/myHomeFolder/Voxel_L_System/Assets/SampleProject/branch.obj 

                                    ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
